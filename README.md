# To Do List
### Is a simple app for create, make & delete tasks developed in C with Nuklear & GLFW on the backend
## Why I have deps.zip?
#### In my Readme.md of the ManuelTeves/ManuelTeves i use https://github-readme-stats-eight-theta.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=TevesManuel&layout=compact&langs_count=8&theme=algolia for my programing langs stats, and the code inside of the deps.zip is not my code and hinders my programing langs stats, and i automate saving the deps to deps.zip and unzip the deps.zip for better workflow
## How build my project?
- #### Unzip deps.zip inside include folder
- #### Run make
``` bash
make
```
